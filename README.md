# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. It is built using Python and the scikit-learn library.

- Features include:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age
  - Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)
